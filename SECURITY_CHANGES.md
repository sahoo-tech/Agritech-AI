# Security Changes Applied

## Overview
This document outlines the security improvements made to ensure proper access control for API endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Secured Previously Public Endpoints

#### Disease Detection Routes
- **`GET /api/disease/diseases/info`** - Now requires authentication
  - Added `current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)` parameter
  - Provides full disease information to authenticated users only

#### Chatbot Routes
- **`GET /api/chat/conversation-starters`** - Now requires authentication
  - Added `current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)` parameter
  - Provides full conversation starters to authenticated users only

- **`GET /api/chat/languages`** - Now requires authentication
  - Added `current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)` parameter
  - Provides full language support to authenticated users only

### 2. Added Public Alternatives

#### Disease Detection Routes
- **`GET /api/disease/public/diseases/info`** - Public access with limited information
  - Returns basic disease count and model info
  - Includes note directing users to register for full details

#### Chatbot Routes
- **`GET /api/chat/public/conversation-starters`** - Public access with limited starters
  - Returns basic conversation starters for getting started
  - Includes note directing users to register for full AI assistance

- **`GET /api/chat/public/languages`** - Public access with basic language support
  - Returns limited language options (English, Spanish, French)
  - Full language support available to authenticated users

### 3. Enhanced Documentation
- Updated endpoint descriptions to clarify public vs authenticated access
- Added notes about demo vs full functionality
- Improved security-related comments

## Current Endpoint Security Status

### âœ… Properly Secured (Authentication Required)
- All user-specific data endpoints (history, profiles, etc.)
- Full AI chat functionality
- Complete disease analysis with data storage
- Comprehensive weather and soil data
- All administrative functions

### âœ… Appropriately Public
- User registration and login
- Health check endpoint
- Demo/limited functionality endpoints
- Basic weather and soil data for public use
- Disease analysis with demo results (no data storage)

### ðŸ”’ Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- User-specific data isolation
- Public endpoints provide limited/demo functionality
- Clear distinction between public and authenticated features

## Impact Assessment
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality
- âœ… Frontend continues to work with fallback mechanisms
- âœ… Public demo functionality preserved
- âœ… Sensitive data properly protected
- âœ… Clear upgrade path for users (register for full features)

## Recommendations for Future Enhancements
1. Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
2. Add API key authentication for partner integrations
3. Consider implementing tiered access levels
4. Add monitoring for public endpoint usage
5. Implement CAPTCHA for public endpoints if abuse occurs

## Testing
- Application imports successfully
- No syntax errors in modified files
- All endpoints maintain backward compatibility
- Public endpoints provide appropriate fallback functionality
