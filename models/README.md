# Plant Disease Detection Models

This directory contains the machine learning models and related files for the Agritech AI plant disease detection system.

## 🌱 Overview

Our advanced plant disease detection system uses deep learning to identify diseases across multiple crop types with high accuracy. The system is built on EfficientNet-B4 architecture and supports 38+ disease classes across 14+ crop types.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```python
from models.plant_disease_model import DiseaseDetectionPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = DiseaseDetectionPipeline()

# Detect disease from image
result = pipeline.detect_disease("path/to/plant/image.jpg")
print(result)
```
